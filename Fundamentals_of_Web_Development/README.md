In this module, I learned everything I need to know to start my carrer in Web Development. With this modules, I am prepared to face the other modules, such as Front-end and Back-end.

## The Module is divided into four parts:

 - In the beginning, I learned about a famous operational system called UNIX.
 Pra começar, você vai estudar um pouco sobre um famoso tipo de sistema operacional chamado UNIX . Vamos colocar a mão na massa e executar alguns comandos no terminal.
 - After understand what the commands work on the shell and already created my first scripts, I learn about the use of Git to store them in a safe way. Besides that, I see some concepts and funcionalities of the Internet and how it works.
 - Now I got to the fun part: Web Development. Here I learned the structure of an HTML document, how to give a better visual structure, layout and aesthetics with CSS and how to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else with JavaScript.
 - Another skill that I developed was to use advanced resources from JavaScript, like HOF, Asynchronus Code, Unit Test, etc...
