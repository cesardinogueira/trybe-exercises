          <h3>Learning about Mantis Shrimp</h3>
          <div id="main-article-text">
            <p>Mantis shrimp, or stomatopods, are carnivorous marine crustaceans of the
              order Stomatopoda, branching from other members of the class Malacostraca
              around 340 million years ago. Mantis shrimps typically grow to around 10 cm
              (3.9 in) in length, while a few can reach up to 38 cm (15 in).A mantis
              shrimp's carapace (the hard, thick shell that covers crustaceans and some other
              species) covers only the rear part of the head and the first four segments of the
              thorax. Varieties range in colour from shades of brown to vivid colours, with more
              than 450 species of mantis shrimp being known. They are among the most important
              predators in many shallow, tropical and subtropical marine habitats. However,
              despite being common, they are poorly understood, as many species spend most of
              their lives tucked away in burrows and holes.

              Called "sea locusts" by ancient Assyrians, "prawn killers" in Australia, and now
              sometimes referred to as "thumb splitters"—because of the animal's ability to
              inflict painful wounds if handled incautiously—mantis shrimps have powerful
              raptorials that are used to attack and kill prey either by spearing, stunning, or
              dismembering. Some mantis shrimp species have specialised calcified "clubs" that can
              strike with great power, while others have sharp forelimbs used to seize the prey
              (hence the term "mantis" in its common name). </p>
